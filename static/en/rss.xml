&lt;p&gt;When I was younger I used to build simple websites with Geocities and Microsoft Frontpage. I was more focused with the design aspect of websites rather than actual programming - not because I had no interest in programming, but rather because I found it intimidating. I was scared to even start. I eventually started to design websites in Photoshop and slice them with some basic HTML and CSS knowledge, but would progress no further. I simply enjoyed designing and would do it for fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had an idea for a phone and SIM contract comparison website, where users could search from thousands of deals and filter down to their specific needs. There were already a few out there, but I found a lot of them lacking in features, generally low in quality and would promote specific deals that would earn them more commission rather than showing the cheapest possible deals. How hard could it be, right? Boy was I wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My idea was to design the website and hire someone to make it. I made notes, drew sketches and obsessed over how the site would work. I have a tendency to over design and obsess over minor details, to a point where it holds me back. Everything had to work, behave and be constructed in a very specific way. If I hired someone to make my product and it wasn‚Äôt up to my exact standards, I wouldn‚Äôt progress with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quickly realised that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to get my product made up to my standard unless I was willing to spend A LOT of money. Even then, I still probably wouldn‚Äôt be satisfied. The only other logical solution was to learn how to program and make it myself, which is exactly what I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did some research and landed on JavaScript as the ideal language for me to learn and build my product, as I could use my skills on the front end and back end. I followed every basic JavaScript tutorial and eventually landed on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS&quot;&gt;You Don‚Äôt Know Js&lt;/a&gt; - an absolute must read, even for experienced JS developers. I tried to pick up on my basic HTML and CSS skills from years ago, but I found myself starting from scratch. ‚ÄòFlexbox? Grids? What the hell is any of this?!?‚Äù - I used to use tables back in my day! I also followed some online tutorials for basic SQL, realising I would need a database of some sort to store all the deals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to feel a bit more confident, even though I hadn‚Äôt even begun to build. Eventually, after hours of pulling my hair out, I somehow pulled together a simple prototype that just about worked. It was rubbish, but I thought it was the best thing ever at the time. I couldn‚Äôt even imagine I would be able to progress past simple JS a few months prior, but here I was, with something I could be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a perfectionist, in the coming months I must have started over from scratch hundreds of times. I wasn‚Äôt happy. Eventually, I convinced myself to plan on launching. I started to add more retailers and feeds to my website, but I hit a bottleneck - the website became mind bogglingly slow. I was building my product around one or two retailers with no more than 1,000 deals. But now, I had over 200,000 deals, and everything grinded to a halt. A simple request would take up to 10 seconds. How could I be so stupid? I tried optimising my SQL, learning about database indexes, but with no avail. I was tempted to throw in the towel, but somehow persisted, eventually learning about caching and indexing. I ended up adding Redis and Meilisearch to the stack. It was a blessing in disguise as I learnt so much about how to architect such a product for performance - something that I wouldn‚Äôt have learnt if I did not run into this bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some technologies I‚Äôve learnt along the way, all within a few hours of work a few week in just under 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nginx&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meilisearch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Postgres&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Git &amp;amp; GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, my launched product:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.comparedial.com&quot;&gt;CompareDial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

During this period, we received &lt;em&gt;a lot of positive feedback on video effects and text animation&lt;/em&gt;, which is used by every 5th user of the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there were also problems with the speed of video generation, which were partially solved, and, I am sure, will be completely solved in the coming months of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we do not stand still and, in addition to some cosmetic and technical issues, we are trying to solve more conceptual problems.&lt;br/&gt;
And today we are glad to present you our new functionality - üõ† customizable video templates. The main advantage of our solution is that they:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;templates are easy to create and edit at üíØ;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;quickly customize to your corporate identity and company brand;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;generated for the format (üíª, üñ•, üì∫, üìü, etc.) of all well-known social networks and video hosting.&lt;br/&gt;
It is also convenient to make a whole bunch of videos using a prepared template by quickly replacing elements in the editor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ask you to support usü§ùon the day of release on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/online-video-templates-by-pixiko-com&quot;&gt;ProductHunt&lt;/a&gt; üí™ and leave a feedback or review about our service, cause we are very sensitive to changes in the editor and bring the level of service to the maximum.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#39;s a new money manager provided as a fully responsive Web App (and PWA) that I&amp;#39;ve developed in my spare time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, the app needed seven months of development to reach the current MVP status. The app is now ready for the closed beta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the homepage, you can have a full overview of the application: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.manamoney.me&quot;&gt;https://www.manamoney.me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Currently this is an MVP (minimum viable product), so I invite you to NOT SAVE personal information and to NOT USE IT AS YOUR MAIN MONEY MANAGER. If the app will gain interest, it will be subjected to a general security check before making it public.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/y9csnk3r68871.png?width=801&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a3877bdc5136e35552a832d6294fa5ab83b5f139&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/y9csnk3r68871.png?width=801&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a3877bdc5136e35552a832d6294fa5ab83b5f139&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it does?&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#39;s a money manager with a minimalistic interface and a lot of peculiar features. Basically, you can use it to keep track of all your transactions (incomes/outcomes), categorize them, and analyze your current and future economic situation in the analytics section. All the cooler features are listed on the homepage with some illustrations, so if you are interested, please check the link up above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.redd.it/d300cgax78871.gif&quot;&gt;https://i.redd.it/d300cgax78871.gif&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Languages&lt;/strong&gt; At the moment, ManaMoney is available only in the English language (and there are a lot of improvements to do on this aspect. Unfortunately I am not a native speaker). Other languages will be implemented in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everything for free?!&lt;/strong&gt; The web application is available for free and probably it will forever be. You can signup by email/password or with your Google account, no payment is needed. In the future, the app will provide also an optional Premium Subscription that unlocks some cool features (already developed) like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SHARED-ACCOUNT(*)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RECURRENT TRANSACTIONS(*)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BUDGET ESTIMATION(*)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the Premium Status is only available for all selected beta testers that will receive the Premium Subscription for free (limited time). If there will be interest in this app, after the beta-testing phase I will open the Premium Subscription to all users (price and conditions aren&amp;#39;t defined yet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to become a beta tester&lt;/strong&gt; Right now, the application is young and I think that is really premature to open all premium features to everyone. Before doing this big step, it&amp;#39;s extremely important to get some important feedback from real users, improve the application, and, only after that, there will be a reason to open all features to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to become a beta tester, try the application first, and, if you feel that you can contribute to the product growth, please:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fill in the Beta Tester form: &lt;a href=&quot;https://forms.gle/N2PZwyRwQxkv6V2XA&quot;&gt;https://forms.gle/N2PZwyRwQxkv6V2XA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subscribe and start to share feedback/tips/suggestions on to the ManaMoney reddit community &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/manamoney/&quot;&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/manamoney/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all requests on the Beta Testing Program will be accepted obviously. Also keep in mind that joining in the  beta testing program will entail some activities like filling form, share feedback, etc. Ask to become a beta tester only if you really want to be part of this :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/duzb4xiz78871.png?width=801&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7bf3feb91d20bccb46749f0f01ad873bbde678cd&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/duzb4xiz78871.png?width=801&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7bf3feb91d20bccb46749f0f01ad873bbde678cd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to share feedback&lt;/strong&gt; If you want to share a suggestion or report a bug, you can use all information stored in the application footer. Or, if you want to be actively part of this project, please subscribe to the Reddit community &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/manamoney&quot;&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/manamoney&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#39;s safe to store personal information?!&lt;/strong&gt; Like any other application, your data will be stored in an online database. Data breaches occur daily on the internet even to billionaire companies. I&amp;#39;ve done all the possible to make it as secure as possible, but I am not specialized in the security sector. Please, check the disclaimer at the beginning of the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What next&lt;/strong&gt; This is a side project with ZERO BUDGET. So, things will be plenty slow at the beginning. The application is complete and has all the main features that I would ask a Money Manager. The intention is to make it grow with new features and improvements during next months. You can check the &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/b/daB4tVuz/manamoney-roadmap&quot;&gt;ManaMoney&amp;#39;s Roadmap on Trello&lt;/a&gt;. If you aren&amp;#39;t interested to try the application in this state of MVP, please, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gmail.us6.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=4c169224b5b97a598fbd6ecb7&amp;amp;id=e99591aa13&quot;&gt;Subscribe to ManaMoney&amp;#39;s newsletter to receive future updates.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me share with you a project I created mostly for fun. I am currently looking for monetization ideas though - so will appreciate your ideas and any feedback really!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I myself have moved to a different country a few times, and likely not the last time in my life. And I&amp;#39;ve found it quite difficult to compare not consumer prices, say, for tomatoes or a 2-bed apartment, but my lifestyle as a whole, including how many people are moving, what habits we have, and what services we use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address the issue, I built this calculator: &lt;a href=&quot;https://gromov.com/cost-of-living-calc?utm_source=reddit_sideproj&quot;&gt;https://gromov.com/cost-of-living-calc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ö†Ô∏èIt currently doesn&amp;#39;t work on mobile devices (WIP), so please use desktop version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that, it shall be fairly straightforward and hopefully fun to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Predis is essentially an AI/ML-based SaaS that predicts a social media post‚Äôs performance before it is posted, so it can be improved with the AI‚Äôs suggestions. Influencers and brands can also carry out comprehensive competitor analysis on Predis to understand the kind of content that is working well for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I basically divided this blog into 4 distinct sections:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Why we changed our target platform from Twitter to Instagram&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- How our Product Hunt launch fared (spoiler: not very well)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Our LTD offering on Pitchground&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Key learnings from some user metrics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check out the Medium blog &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/predisai/predis-ai-2-months-overview-apr-may-2021-db9180f711fd&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;! Hoping this will provide useful insights to new founders about what to expect when at the helm of a SaaS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://productdisrupt.com/&quot;&gt;Product Disrupt&lt;/a&gt; - Curated List of Resources to Learn Product Design&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now back to my app. YourTrail is a personal assistant to plan, track and achieve your goals and aspirations. I just finished building an MVP and would love to hear your thoughts about the MVP and the idea in general. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check out YourTrail here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://yourtrail.io&quot;&gt;https://yourtrail.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app lets you plan your life goals, organize your book notes and other learnings, and connect them with your goals. It will also have a suite of productivity tools like streaks (habit building), timeboxed working sessions &amp;amp; daily reminders to help you take small daily steps towards your goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using YourTrail, you can break down complex goals into simple, actionable steps and have fun doing it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any feedback and comments are greatly appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, OneStream TV is a streaming aggregator that allows you to have free streaming access on content on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, HBO Max, and many other streaming services, without subscribing to any service or paying money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know what you&amp;#39;re thinking: &amp;quot;Is this legal?&amp;quot;. Answer is yes, 100% legal :). Many streaming services provide free access (without requiring subscription) to a limited number of their content as part of their holistic marketing strategy, but these free content are randomly provided by streaming services because they&amp;#39;re usually part of some complex promotional marketing strategy, which means it&amp;#39;s hard for the average consumer to easily discover and access the content. So OneStream TV solves this problem programmatically by automatically monitoring, indexing, and aggregating all the free content being provided by all the major streaming services and combining them in one unified streaming dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m posting this here mainly to get you guys&amp;#39; feedback and reaction, so please let me know what you guys think, if you like it (any feature requests), or if you think I should shut it down :-).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Solve your own problems. Meaning, live on the edge of tech and see what issues you encounter. Then build a startup to solve it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree, and I love that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s not the whole answer you want. Where do these problems actually come from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I‚Äôll start by defining what a good startup idea looks like to me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It offers a meaningful benefit, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¢ A big reduction of an intense/frequent frustration&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¢ A big reduction in the cost of an expensive problem&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¢ A big increase in how entertaining/emotional a thing is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) I call these 3x ideas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Äî ideas compelling enough to overcome the friction to try &amp;#39;em. Btw, some people say startups must be &amp;quot;10x better to succeed.&amp;quot; This is misleading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an app to be 10x better, than, say, Uber, it would have to straight up teleport you to your destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Examples of real 3x ideas:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¢ Dropbox/Box: Cheaply share files without coordination or friction&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¢ Instacart: Get groceries delivered‚Äîwithout a big cost premium&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¢ Uber: Get a cab 3x faster, in 3x more locations, and for cheaper&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) So, where do these 3x ideas come from?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the creation of new infrastructure‚Äîeither technological or legal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep an eye on this. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¢ Fast mobile processors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¢ High-capacity batteries&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¢ Cryptocurrency architecture&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¢ VR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Changes in the law&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¢ Legalization of marijuana&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¢ Patents expiring (And 1,000 more infrastructure examples.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When new technological/legal infrastructure emerges, startups pounce to productize the new 3x possibilities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those possibilities fall into categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Cost reductions:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¢ Cheaper broadband enables cloud storage (Dropbox)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¢ Cheaper batteries enables electric cars (Tesla)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Better functionality:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¢ Smartphones and 3G spawned the mobile era&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Brand new categories:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¢ The legalization of marijuana spawned weed stores and weed delivery apps (And more.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So takeaway number one is that new infrastructure spawns startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;But, we&amp;#39;re not done.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those ideas to survive in the market, I believe you need another criterion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cultural acceptance. Society has to be ready for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are startups that became possible through changes in societal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Pop culture making behaviors less cool:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¢ Cigarettes go out of style, so we get nicotine and vaping&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¢ Heavy drinking goes out of style, so we get low-alcohol seltzers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Mobile apps making it more normal to trust strangers:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¢ The rise of Uber, Airbnb, Tinder, and couchsurfing better acclimated society to trusting people they‚Äôve only met over the Internet. This next part is important:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6) Implication&lt;/strong&gt;: Study changes in infrastructure plus shifts in cultural acceptance to identify what‚Äôs newly possible in your market. Here&amp;#39;s an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uber saw that widespread smartphone adoption with accurate GPS data made it possible to replace taxis with gig workers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cultural acceptance was needed here‚Äîbecause it was unorthodox to step into a stranger&amp;#39;s car and entrust them with your safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7) Okay, so let&amp;#39;s turn all this into a framework.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s just one way to find startup ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Spot upcoming infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Determine if market entry is now possible&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Explore second-order ideas too&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8) Second, when another startup captures a 3x benefit,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it typically produces many downstream 2x ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a key point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, now that millions use 3x products like Slack, Zoom, and Uber, what tools could make them less expensive, more reliable, more collaborative?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9) To recap:&lt;/strong&gt; One way to find startup ideas is to study infrastructure (3x ideas) and observe what emerges from startups that tackle that infrastructure (2x ideas).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;üí° Tip:&lt;/em&gt; If you enjoyed this then maybe I can tempt you with my Twitter page where I write daily insights on startups investing like this. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/__Uplift&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learn more ‚Üí&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

From childhood, I am fascinated by the idea of building a real-intelligent machine, like housekeeping-robot Andrew in the movie &amp;quot;Bicentennial Man&amp;quot; or SETTLER in ‚ÄúExpelled from Paradise (Rakuen Tsuih≈ç)‚Äù. After graduating, I made a lot of practical software, but my inner flame of artificial intelligence has never been extinguished. My new app &lt;a href=&quot;https://dreamily.ai&quot;&gt;dreamily.ai&lt;/a&gt; may make it possible to see a ray of light into these dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language can plot scenes, and a language model which can predict what will happen is a world simulator. For example, you can create a scene in outer space :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alpha Centauri, the 13th fleet of the Free Planet Alliance is moving through here very carefully.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the AI will continue to write:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They&amp;#39;re not sure if they want to make a big mistake and attract more attention than necessary. This is just their second attempt to find this new star system, the one that was supposedly inhabited by some sort of sentient life, but it&amp;#39;s proving unsuccessful. They&amp;#39;ve been searching for weeks now without any luck at all&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suddenly, a spaceship of unknown origin appeared on the radar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will happen next? in Universe #1, they hide:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suddenly, a spaceship of unknown origin appeared on the radar and quickly moved in their direction. Their ships slowed down to avoid being noticed. After a few hours, when they were certain that the ship hadn&amp;#39;t spotted them&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/v4175j4buu571.png?width=2236&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ec562a9ceca24c33197ed50ffc2087088d63fd9f&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/v4175j4buu571.png?width=2236&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ec562a9ceca24c33197ed50ffc2087088d63fd9f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in Universe #2, they fight:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They were ready to call in reinforcements from Alpha Centauri when the ship made a sharp turn and headed straight towards them. The sensors went crazy with warnings, and as Alpha Centauri fired on it, it disappeared into a ball of fire. It wasn&amp;#39;t long before the first wave of ships started appearing behind it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/me82eg3iuu571.png?width=2218&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=65c761e87420aed8debed62fc8adab5746bf57ba&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/me82eg3iuu571.png?width=2218&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=65c761e87420aed8debed62fc8adab5746bf57ba&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
