I love tools like Airtable, Miro, and Figma but it&amp;#39;s also a lot to stitch together a clear understanding of who the user is across all these tools- especially if you have multiple projects.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why I started building &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.personifyhq.com&quot;&gt;Personify&lt;/a&gt; on the side of my full-time job leading design to make user research more actionable and accessible for my product teams.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a persona based framework that focuses on identifying core needs, pain points, and responsibilities of your users rather than demographics or attitudinal data that&amp;#39;s just really arbitrary.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does it work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build the first draft of your persona based on what you know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a research goal of how many users you want to interview.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bookmark links to your research wherever you store it (GDrive, Dropbox, etc.) and build up a unified view of your user knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you&amp;#39;ve bookmarked user research to reach your goal - you can publish the persona to our Gallery to share your knowledge and inspire others. (Kind of like a Dribbble for researched personas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently released our second Beta release after 5 months of work refining some of the user experience and we&amp;#39;ve got some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/personify/Roadmap-83ee1b79793248ef84c32e288284e45e&quot;&gt;ideas&lt;/a&gt; of what we could work on next - but we really want that to be informed by our users and their &lt;a href=&quot;https://personifyhq.typeform.com/roadmapvote&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a fun project to work on and I hope it brings some value to your side projects as you work on yours!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Query with JSONPath and compare with JSON Patch.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thefullstack.network/invite/rsideproject21&quot;&gt;https://thefullstack.network&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a long term itch of mine to start a platform like this - similar to platforms I admire like Behance and Dribbble, The Full Stack is a platform designed for software engineering that I wished had existed throughout my career and to this very day. I am excited with the aim this platform helps engineers, managers and teams on their journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Showcase you and your projects on a professional network specifically for Software Engineering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect with like minded engineers and build a more meaningful network (without the spam)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t let your work get overlooked, let it connect you to opportunities from Teams and Engineering Managers looking for engineers just like you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike other networks liked LinkedIn, (there are no recruiters) when &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; engineering hiring managers reach out to you on The Full Stack, you get paid into your wallet for reading and responding to opportunities, putting you in control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone interested, the platform is built in Next.js, Tailwind, Spring, NodeJS, MongoDB with integrations to Mux and SendGrid&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would really appreciate your feedback, input and learnings from everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://thefullstack.network/invite/rsideproject21&quot;&gt;https://thefullstack.network&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have just released a free app Devsigner helping everyone  to create production-graded app icons for their iOS apps easily. You can find the app here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/devsigner/id1573136365&quot;&gt;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/devsigner/id1573136365&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am an iOS developer and have a passtion of creating iOS apps. But most of the time, I find myself spending more time in creating graphic assets for my apps than writing code. Especially for the app icons, where iOS developers need to generate a lot of sizes for different purposes in catalog assets. Moreover a developer doesn&amp;#39;t necessary has enough designig skills or required tools to create such icons easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devsigner tries to solve this problem by providing a simple tool to help any developer to create an app icon in an easy way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;💕 Multiple icon fonts such as Material Fonts from Google, Fluent System from Microsoft, and Fontawesome
🥰 Twitter emojis
🔡 Over hundred built-in fonts from iOS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find more info at the app &lt;a href=&quot;https://devsigner.antran.app/&quot;&gt;landing page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app supports generation of asset catalogs and they can be imported into Xcode directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d love to hear your feedback and feel free to suggest new ideas or tell me what is missing from the app. I will try my best to get them implemented. Feel free to leave comment here or contact me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/antranapp&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I decided to target Elasticsearch, being the most used search engine database out there. I am determined to fix, or at least improve where I can, on the following issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elasticsearch is incredibly annoying to configure. There are hundreds of settings and configurations to choose, and many of them are one way doors - for example, once you configure your shard count you cannot change it without a full migration to reindex your data into a new index.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similar to anything that isnt serverless, having to constantly monitor and worry about CPU, memory pressure and other metrics is something no one has time for in the real world. Elasticsearch has launched an autoscaling policy feature, but this will still hit issues for users who have big jumps in usage and leaves yet another complexity for the user to configure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again, common to serverless is the issue of developers having to over-provision their instances and have unused capacity just sitting around - seems like a loss for everyone involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;#39;d reach out to the community to see if anyone like me would like to see Serverless Search and whether they would find it useful in their applications.&lt;/p&gt;

I work on a series called FontDiscovery. Every week I create a digestible visual guide about fonts, marketing, and design ideas to help founders and markers step up their marketing and get creative! This week, I share a graffiti font for flashy marketing projects like swags. I also share creative tips about stickers, which is a great tool to DIY and help you grow your brand awareness. If you have to create designs for your projects and business, try these and let me know what you think!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Font of the Week: Disko&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disko is a fat, graffiti-inspired font that feels a little old school. The letters, puffy like marshmallows, remind you of bubble letters*.* At its natural state (if you don&amp;#39;t manipulate the letter-spacing), Disko letters overlap to create a hand-drawn vibe. Disk communicates loud, funkiness, urban in a bold and colloquial tone. Because it has a colloquial, urban tone, it is only appropriate for particular brands. For example, those focusing on youth, pop culture, urban spaces, or similar. It may not be right for something that looks to be classic or serious. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Design Idea of the Week: Stickers as an opportunity&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stickers are a great way to get your business name out there. At conferences and events, you will see stickers all over. Stickers increase brand awareness and are relatively easy to DIY. If you have a printer, you can even make them at home with adhesive paper. While you could be using your logo, the design can also be an opportunity to build up emotional connections with your customers. What if you use a word or catchphrase? What if you create a cute mascot? What if you use custom memes for your brand?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I share tips like this weekly, you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://fonts.substack.com/&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt; if you feel like. If you would like to read the original post, you can see it at fonts.substack.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you know, in recent years social media companies have started to control and manipulate society. Algorithms promote content that sparks outrage, hate, and amplifies biases to further monetize us. A lot of concerned users have already left social media long time ago because they couldn&amp;#39;t find a better alternative. Unfortunately, they continue to destroy our communities every day. We believe, there should be some independent and public-owned social media alternatives to private social media networks. (#TheSocialDilemma #biasedbanning)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We created a new social media project, called &amp;quot;JustOne&amp;quot;. JustOne is a women &amp;amp; LGBTQIA+ managed nonprofit ethical photo sharing social media network. It is also going to be fully open source and run on a decentralized network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: We greatly value your feedback. And also, looking for other co-founders for partnership. Please DM me for the Testflight invitations, but also feel free to provide general feedback about the idea. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

I recently launched a new version of the first-of-its-kind mood-inducing text editor that lets you write in a completely distraction free zone as the background plays ambient music according to your mood/writing theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s free to use on &lt;strong&gt;laptop/desktop&lt;/strong&gt; devices at &lt;a href=&quot;https://frostwriter.com/&quot;&gt;frostwriter.com&lt;/a&gt;. Recommended browser: Chrome. Headphones recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep reading if you wanna learn more about the new features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/7h7q85227rj71.png?width=635&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=33b6bcccc34a48367fd3fd316afc848b8578110b&quot;&gt;https://preview.redd.it/7h7q85227rj71.png?width=635&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=33b6bcccc34a48367fd3fd316afc848b8578110b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frost 3.0 had the following features which users loved the most :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completely distraction-free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ad-free Music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to download your file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dark theme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall ad-free experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.0 takes all these features to the next level by bringing features like minimal dynamic backgrounds, full bleed, background shuffle, and over 30 ambient themes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inspiration behind the application:&lt;/strong&gt; I just wanted to have a platform for writers and poets who wish to write to music. Nobody has the time to search for the &amp;#39;perfect&amp;#39; soundtrack while writing and you just can&amp;#39;t afford to get the muse get away while doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was just featured on Product Hunt too and I&amp;#39;d love to see what you guys think: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/frost-4-0&quot;&gt;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/frost-4-0&lt;/a&gt; !!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a game dev and I like brainstorming and daydreaming about categories and genres.  It can also function as a news feed just to see what games have buzz currently, although right now it&amp;#39;s just &amp;#39;all time popular&amp;#39;, not &amp;#39;recent popular&amp;#39; which is in the works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How it works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone can post any game, any stage of dev, historical or current, and click tags to index it.  I aim to keep streamlining the tags to keep it intuitive to browse, although the tag cloud is starting to get a little crowded.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Permissions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A game owner can &amp;#39;claim&amp;#39; their game entry if someone else is doin it wrong and they want to take over.  Otherwise it&amp;#39;s a FFA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tech:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the game data is returned client side currently, which makes searching licketysplit fast.  But eventually I&amp;#39;ll have to switch to cached serverside searches.  I might websocket the searches though to try to preserve the feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting noticed at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject&quot;&gt;r/SideProject&lt;/a&gt; and over at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad&quot;&gt;r/digitalnomad&lt;/a&gt;, things picked up. Great blogs started to mention Pipewing, e.g., here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.makeuseof.com/apps-guides-to-become-a-digital-nomad-and-work-as-you-travel/&quot;&gt;https://www.makeuseof.com/apps-guides-to-become-a-digital-nomad-and-work-as-you-travel/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are big blogs with high domain authority. Here is my opinion: &lt;strong&gt;If you build something that is of true value, it will be shared by blogs, on social media, etc. If it is not - maybe your product isn&amp;#39;t as valuable after all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a lot of content marketing for other projects and products as well. Sometimes it&amp;#39;s worth spending the time and money to build a strong backlink profile and press coverage. Sometimes it is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re in the early stage of a side project or startup, maybe it&amp;#39;s a great idea to inform your target audience about what you&amp;#39;re doing without being overly aggressive. If people share what you do, you know you&amp;#39;re on to something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back weeks ago, I felt bored with my Mac which I spent the whole day coding on. Besides, I missed the peaceful moments that my puppy was sleeping around while I studied during school time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I came up with the idea to build an app that shows a sleeping pet on the menu bar, and the pet might remind you to take a break too (I am a fan of the Pomodoro technique). I was so excited about that and spent nights and weekends building it. Besides, I ordered the freelance designer to sketch the icon pack too.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finishing MVP, I shared it with some of my friends for feedback. After several feedback loops, I improved the app and released the first version on Mac App Store as a paid app ($3.99).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, several days ago, I decided to share on /macapps subreddit to get more feedback. Unbelievably, it became a hit. I got a lot of great comments and feature requests that I have not even thought of. Some of them even had a private chat with me. They are so nice to give me suggestions. The most useful ones are from a CTO who gave me an actionable list of feedback.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, after gathering feedback, I jumped into updating the app and releasing a new version within 24 hours. Wow, people love that, especially, the users who had requests for new pets. I added 3 new ones in that version. It reinforced what I learned that &amp;quot;listening to the users and making them happy&amp;quot; is a correct direction for product development and business. And the great idea usually is the one that solves our own problem.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, here is my app (PetBar) on &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/petbar-a-pet-on-your-menu-bar/id1580266242?l=en&amp;amp;mt=12&quot;&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt; in case you want to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading and have a nice day.&lt;/p&gt;
