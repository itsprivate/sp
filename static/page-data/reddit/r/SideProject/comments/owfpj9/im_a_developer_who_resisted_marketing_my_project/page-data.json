And since we’re doing a logo design product, I thought that focusing on these areas would be enough to succeed.</p>\n\n<p>From the start though, people kept telling me to focus on distribution and marketing.</p>\n\n<p>It made sense but I felt that it didn’t apply to us. I was convinced that <em>finding product-market fit</em> would be enough to make us successful.</p>\n\n<p>Just like the unicorn success stories you see all the time. I hoped that we would be so good and disruptive that we would become viral. I assumed actual marketing wouldn’t be needed.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/lejhbxlwfye71.jpg?width=650&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05759c7c5df5afc959791618910f3974293ce1ba\">https://preview.redd.it/lejhbxlwfye71.jpg?width=650&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05759c7c5df5afc959791618910f3974293ce1ba</a></p>\n\n<h2>How it started</h2>\n\n<p>Actually, focusing on the product worked well in the beginning.</p>\n\n<p>When we launched last year, we had 1 sale out of every 800 visits. There were still big problems in the flow.</p>\n\n<p>So by spending time on features, we got it down to 1 sale out of every 200 visits. It was a big improvement!</p>\n\n<p>But by focusing on that exclusively, we stopped trying to get traffic. And even with a better-performing website, it didn’t sell that much.</p>\n\n<p>By January 2021, we had already fixed the bigger problems with our site.</p>\n\n<p>But we kept focusing on features until the end of May, except for some participation on indiehackers and reddit.</p>\n\n<p>This didn’t lead to any major improvement in sales and got us down to a tiny ~700 users and 7 sales per month. Even worse, half of those were late conversions from traffic acquired in 2020.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/fwfntmoxfye71.png?width=1928&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a567d33fb64e09ed28fa4ab5410f10a052d239c9\">https://preview.redd.it/fwfntmoxfye71.png?width=1928&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a567d33fb64e09ed28fa4ab5410f10a052d239c9</a></p>\n\n<h2>Seeing the problem</h2>\n\n<p>As the months went by and we kept improving the product, we experienced firsthand how it didn’t change anything.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of our efforts, we were still barely selling a handful of logos a month.</p>\n\n<p>So eventually we had no choice but to admit it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We did not create a product so mind-blowing that it became an instant-hit. We’re not the next Facebook or Uber.</strong></p>\n\n<p>And that means we need to do marketing.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/lsflwjmyfye71.jpg?width=690&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efcb381cef1d81592d524430246d162bc9cd9742\">https://preview.redd.it/lsflwjmyfye71.jpg?width=690&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efcb381cef1d81592d524430246d162bc9cd9742</a></p>\n\n<h2>Making the switch</h2>\n\n<p>I really didn’t want to do marketing.</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to create my dream job, where I could do what I love every day (code and UX) without a boss telling me what to do. Now I have to learn something that seems like a big chore?!</p>\n\n<p>Lucky for me, my target market is founders and entrepreneurs. So I took the smallest step that I could: participate more in online communities.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn’t feel like marketing if it’s just « participating » 😅</p>\n\n<p>So I became more active on twitter, indiehackers, and reddit. I joined lots of private slack groups.</p>\n\n<p>I forced myself to reply to tweets for hours and bring value to every online discussion that I could.</p>\n\n<p>It felt like a grind at first, and it was hard to not work on my product.</p>\n\n<p>But after a couple of weeks, one of my 100s of replies got viral on twitter. It got us thousands of visits and a couple of sales.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/d75apcg0gye71.png?width=1190&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25ec4b13b47995fffd9aaddf9e645b3ec05746e6\">https://preview.redd.it/d75apcg0gye71.png?width=1190&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25ec4b13b47995fffd9aaddf9e645b3ec05746e6</a></p>\n\n<p>I had finally gotten a win 🤩.</p>\n\n<h2>Marketing as a priority</h2>\n\n<p>This made me want to double down, and by staying consistent, sure enough, I kept getting more wins, which led to more traffic and sales.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/yppn67c2gye71.png?width=1934&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=828c6070b2281ed3ea4554dd42b51bebc04466b0\">https://preview.redd.it/yppn67c2gye71.png?width=1934&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=828c6070b2281ed3ea4554dd42b51bebc04466b0</a></p>\n\n<p>I got a bit more comfortable, and it even became something I enjoyed doing. I started making memes about the indie journey (the ones you see in this post) and this led to some more growth for my twitter account.</p>\n\n<p>The best part is I don’t have to be salesy at all. Most of the time I just try to be helpful, share my experience and don’t mention my product.</p>\n\n<p>But people are naturally curious, so if they like my answer, they go check my profile. Then they follow the link to my website 🤷‍♂️.</p>\n\n<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>\n\n<p>Do I still want to do product? Yes. Would I rather live in a world where I can just build a great product and become instantly successful? YES YES YES.</p>\n\n<p>But at some point during my journey, I realized that it was just a fantasy. Sure 1 out of every 1000 founders will hit the jackpot with an instantly viral product. But for most of us, there’s no silver bullet.</p>\n\n<p>If I want my product to succeed, I have to make a conscious choice to make it visible to the world. Even though it still doesn’t come naturally, it&#39;s gotten easier by focusing on bringing value and having fun.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to this, I&#39;m finally making <a href=\"https://www.logology.co/\">logology</a> grow. I hope this article can inspire you to go out there and do the same 🚀</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/owo8uz73gye71.jpg?width=503&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=692d8d248093819767c3eb36b308fd4675c18520\">https://preview.redd.it/owo8uz73gye71.jpg?width=503&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=692d8d248093819767c3eb36b308fd4675c18520</a></p>\n\n<p><em>note: I had</em> <a href=\"https://www.indiehackers.com/post/i-m-a-developer-who-resisted-doing-marketing-for-years-here-s-what-made-me-change-54edb4bd5b\">originally posted</a> <em>this on indiehackers last week</em></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/SideProject/comments/owfpj9/im_a_developer_who_resisted_marketing_my_project/","title":"I’m a developer who resisted marketing my project for years.
