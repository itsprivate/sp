Neither of us had built a SaaS before nor faced the challenges that come along with building one.</p>\n\n<p>We started building in May 2020 and ended up with a prototype on our hands around mid-August 2020.</p>\n\n<h1>Launch</h1>\n\n<p>During the building period, I had been looking into various growth hacks and different ways to scale a SaaS product, we didn&#39;t have money for Paid ads or Influencers, so it basically came down to 2 options - </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Build an Audience </li>\n<li>Content Marketing/SEO</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In order to do both of those, we launched a Lifetime Deal on <a href=\"https://pitchground.com/deals\">PitchGround</a>, for those who don&#39;t know what a Lifetime deal is - its a pricing structure where instead of users paying you monthly, they pay you a bigger lump sum amount to get access to the software for lifetime.</p>\n\n<p>This was a win-win situation for us! We get feedback, and the users get Lifetime access to Listnr.</p>\n\n<p>This was probably one of the biggest mistakes I made early on in your journey - launching a Half baked product. </p>\n\n<p>Listnr was buggy, and not everything was fully functional, we should&#39;ve waited 2 more months to launch but we didn&#39;t.</p>\n\n<h2>Launch Day</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Sept 1, 2020</strong> was when we launched on PitchGround, I was nervous and thrilled at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>15 minutes into the launch - we got our first review - ⭐️  1/5 stars </p>\n\n<p>This was when I realized that launching early was a bad decision, we got over 50+ support requests in the next few hours and were bombarded with bug reports.</p>\n\n<p>The TTS didn&#39;t work, and neither did the hosting and our backend crashed 🙃</p>\n\n<p>I had never faced a situation like this and didn&#39;t know what to do next. So after a couple of hours of panicking, we ended up fixing all the bugs after 2-3 all-nighters (at least we thought we did)</p>\n\n<p>After a few weeks of constant feedback and bug detection, we had turned Listnr into a workable product.</p>\n\n<p>This is what Listnr V1 looked like 👇</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/h5r1gfp\">https://imgur.com/a/h5r1gfp</a></p>\n\n<p>and this is what V2 looked like 👇</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/PKxUQ7h\">https://imgur.com/a/PKxUQ7h</a></p>\n\n<p>Due to the bugs and the difficulties the users faced during the launch, we decided to halt the Lifetime deal for a while and work on improving and polishing the product a little more!</p>\n\n<p>After polishing the product and launching, again and again, we had enough feedback to make the product work well, without any issues.</p>\n\n<h1>Building the future of podcasting!</h1>\n\n<p>Our goal with Listnr is to create an easy-to-use service that lets users create a podcast without any friction!</p>\n\n<p>The easiest way to do this is - combining Recording, Editing, Hosting, Distribution, and Monetisation into one service.</p>\n\n<h2>What&#39;s next?</h2>\n\n<p>We&#39;ll be ending our Lifetime deal in the next few months and have started building our SEO and Content Marketing strategy, our goal is to scale up to 50,000 podcasters in the next 12 months 😎</p>\n\n<h1>TL;DR</h1>\n\n<p>Building a SaaS when you&#39;re broke is harder than it looks! But its definitely doable 😉</p>\n\n<p>The first 4 months of the launch were extremely painful for Listnr, since the product wasn&#39;t ready for a public beta, and we should&#39;ve waited a few months to launch.</p>\n\n<p>We launched a Lifetime Deal with different platforms to get as much feedback as possible, and without any out-of-pocket marketing expense ended up scaling to 6k users and $150k in revenue.</p>\n\n<p>Our Lifetime Deal is currently available on AppSumo, do check it out 👉<br/>\n<a href=\"https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/2947827/1129629/7443\">https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/2947827/1129629/7443</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/SideProject/comments/plkfh5/how_we_scaled_our_saas_from_0_to_150k_in_revenue/","title":"How we scaled our SaaS from 0 to $150k in revenue in 1 year","tags":["SideProject","reddit"],"date":"September 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-10T14:45:29.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-10 14:45","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"plkfh5","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/plkfh5/how_we_scaled_our_saas_from_0_to_150k_in_revenue/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/plkfh5/how_we_scaled_our_saas_from_0_to_150k_in_revenue/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/L0UrQ-3bFThN1Qik-_tO08_vB7pkwI-pHj50SbUEIyo.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=3c44f9808b7c2ee4193a8ae545ce24f7a34198b3","video":null,"channel":"SideProject","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject","author":"INTLHelper","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/INTLHelper","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"INTLHelper","score":5,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"1年でSaaSを0から15万ドルの収益にまで拡大した方法","the_new_excerpt":"ジェネシス\n\nListnr [http://www.listnr.tech/] は、私（Anan Batra - Founder,\nListnr Inc [https://twitter.com/ananbatra]）が、自分のポッドキャストを作りたいと思った後に始まった。\nポッドキャストの制作を簡単にしてくれる既存のソリューションはありませんでした。\n\n唯一それに近いものはAnchor.fm [http://anchor.fm/] でしたが。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我们如何在1年内将我们的SaaS从0扩展到15万美元的收入","the_new_excerpt":"创世纪\n\nListnr [http://www.listnr.tech/] 是在我（Anan Batra - 创始人。\nListnr公司[https://twitter.com/ananbatra]的创始人）想创建自己的播客，但没有发现现有的播客解决方案。\n我（Anan Batra - Listnr Inc[]的创始人）想创建自己的播客，但没有发现任何现有的解决方案能让播客制作变得简单。\n\n唯一接近的是Anchor.fm [http://anchor.fm/]...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我們如何在1年內將我們的SaaS從0擴展到15萬美元的收入","the_new_excerpt":"創世紀\n\nListnr [http://www.listnr.tech/] 是在我（Anan Batra - 創始人。\nListnr公司[https://twitter.com/ananbatra]的創始人）想創建自己的播客，但沒有發現現有的播客解決方案。\n我（Anan Batra - Listnr Inc[]的創始人）想創建自己的播客，但沒有發現任何現有的解決方案能讓播客製作變得簡單。\n\n唯一接近的是Anchor.fm [http://anchor.fm/]...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pljk2a","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/SideProject/comments/pljk2a/i_made_a_free_and_modern_task_manager_called/","title":"I made a free and modern task manager, called Reality Tasks!","date":"September 10, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私はReality Tasksというフリーでモダンなタスクマネージャーを作りました。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我做了一个免费的现代任务管理器，叫做 \"现实任务\"!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我做了一個免費的現代任務管理器，叫做 \"現實任務\"!","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-plqsf8","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/SideProject/comments/plqsf8/i_made_a_app_that_lets_you_have_unlimited/","title":"I made a app that let's you have unlimited floating windows that stay-on-top, giving you space to do even more on your screen.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"September 10, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"私が作ったアプリでは、無制限のフローティングウィンドウが上に表示され、画面上でさらに多くのことができるようになります。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我做了一个应用程序，让你拥有无限的浮动窗口，并保持在顶部，让你有空间在屏幕上做更多事情。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我做了一個應用程序，讓你擁有無限的浮動窗口，並保持在頂部，讓你有空間在屏幕上做更多事情。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-plkfh5","previousId":"RedditPost-pljk2a","nextId":"RedditPost-plqsf8","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/SideProject/comments/plkfh5/how_we_scaled_our_saas_from_0_to_150k_in_revenue/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},
