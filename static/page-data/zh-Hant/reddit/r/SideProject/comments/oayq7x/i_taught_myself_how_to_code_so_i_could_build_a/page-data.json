I was more focused with the design aspect of websites rather than actual programming - not because I had no interest in programming, but rather because I found it intimidating. I was scared to even start. I eventually started to design websites in Photoshop and slice them with some basic HTML and CSS knowledge, but would progress no further. I simply enjoyed designing and would do it for fun.</p>\n\n<p>I had an idea for a phone and SIM contract comparison website, where users could search from thousands of deals and filter down to their specific needs. There were already a few out there, but I found a lot of them lacking in features, generally low in quality and would promote specific deals that would earn them more commission rather than showing the cheapest possible deals. How hard could it be, right? Boy was I wrong.</p>\n\n<p>My idea was to design the website and hire someone to make it. I made notes, drew sketches and obsessed over how the site would work. I have a tendency to over design and obsess over minor details, to a point where it holds me back. Everything had to work, behave and be constructed in a very specific way. If I hired someone to make my product and it wasn’t up to my exact standards, I wouldn’t progress with it.</p>\n\n<p>I quickly realised that I wouldn’t be able to get my product made up to my standard unless I was willing to spend A LOT of money. Even then, I still probably wouldn’t be satisfied. The only other logical solution was to learn how to program and make it myself, which is exactly what I did.</p>\n\n<p>I did some research and landed on JavaScript as the ideal language for me to learn and build my product, as I could use my skills on the front end and back end. I followed every basic JavaScript tutorial and eventually landed on <a href=\"https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS\">You Don’t Know Js</a> - an absolute must read, even for experienced JS developers. I tried to pick up on my basic HTML and CSS skills from years ago, but I found myself starting from scratch. ‘Flexbox? Grids? What the hell is any of this?!?” - I used to use tables back in my day! I also followed some online tutorials for basic SQL, realising I would need a database of some sort to store all the deals.</p>\n\n<p>I started to feel a bit more confident, even though I hadn’t even begun to build. Eventually, after hours of pulling my hair out, I somehow pulled together a simple prototype that just about worked. It was rubbish, but I thought it was the best thing ever at the time. I couldn’t even imagine I would be able to progress past simple JS a few months prior, but here I was, with something I could be proud of.</p>\n\n<p>As a perfectionist, in the coming months I must have started over from scratch hundreds of times. I wasn’t happy. Eventually, I convinced myself to plan on launching. I started to add more retailers and feeds to my website, but I hit a bottleneck - the website became mind bogglingly slow. I was building my product around one or two retailers with no more than 1,000 deals. But now, I had over 200,000 deals, and everything grinded to a halt. A simple request would take up to 10 seconds. How could I be so stupid? I tried optimising my SQL, learning about database indexes, but with no avail. I was tempted to throw in the towel, but somehow persisted, eventually learning about caching and indexing. I ended up adding Redis and Meilisearch to the stack. It was a blessing in disguise as I learnt so much about how to architect such a product for performance - something that I wouldn’t have learnt if I did not run into this bottleneck.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some technologies I’ve learnt along the way, all within a few hours of work a few week in just under 2 years.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>JavaScript</li>\n<li>Node</li>\n<li>Nginx</li>\n<li>Linux</li>\n<li>Redis</li>\n<li>Meilisearch</li>\n<li>SQL</li>\n<li>Postgres</li>\n<li>Git &amp; GitHub</li>\n<li>Bash</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And finally, my launched product:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.comparedial.com\">CompareDial</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/SideProject/comments/oayq7x/i_taught_myself_how_to_code_so_i_could_build_a/","title":"I taught myself how to code so I could build a phone contract comparison website.
