I&amp;#39;ve used quite a few existing products for taking notes and tracking to-do&amp;#39;s in the past, but none were exactly what I was looking for. They didn&amp;#39;t have the right set of features, the UI was confusing, I didn&amp;#39;t feel like paying for a monthly subscription, etc. Yeah I know it&amp;#39;s cliché.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if the perfect app did exist, having one I built from scratch seemed more enticing since I would be able to experiment, tune it exactly to my liking, and maybe publish it some day. And so, while waiting at an airport in August, I created a new directory, ran &amp;quot;git init&amp;quot;, and started coding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week I realized how far the project had come along, and that I&amp;#39;d been using it on a daily basis for a few months already. I think it&amp;#39;s reached reached a point where it might be worth sharing. I spent some time adding all the surrounding pieces (domain name, landing page, account confirmation/password reset emails, etc.) so others could give it a try, and got it to a point where it&amp;#39;s less painful to look at.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In its current form, it&amp;#39;s pretty similar to SimpleNote&amp;#39;s web client. You create an account, write basic text based notes, and sync changes in realtime to other clients. Notes can have embedded TODOs that track duration and state. For now, it only works on a desktop web browser (I had some trouble with touch screen keyboard weirdness), but am planning to eventually support mobile browsers.&lt;br/&gt;\nSome features I&amp;#39;m planning to add as time goes on include:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sharing notes between accounts/public notes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Recurring Tasks and smart suggestions about what to do next&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Task analytics (how long you spend doing various things over time)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Other types of notes (for example drawings, Excalidraw diagrams, or spreadsheets)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cross-platform support (desktop and mobile apps)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happy to answer questions about the tech stack, how it works, and how it got to this point. I&amp;#39;m considering turning it into a real product if I get time some day, but for now it&amp;#39;s just something I&amp;#39;m building on the side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This is my first time sharing this, so there are likely bugs/issues I may haven&amp;#39;t run into yet. I work on operating systems IRL and only do web stuff as a hobby, so the design/appearance will probably be very basic compared to other projects on here :)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/SideProject/comments/rs6bdx/dashnoteapp_my_note_takingtask_tracking_side/","title":"Dashnote.app - My note taking/task tracking side project","tags":["SideProject","reddit"],"date":"December 30, 2021","dateISO":"2021-12-30T20:46:49.000Z","datetime":"2021-12-30 20:46","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"rs6bdx","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/rs6bdx/dashnoteapp_my_note_takingtask_tracking_side/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/rs6bdx/dashnoteapp_my_note_takingtask_tracking_side/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"SideProject","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject","author":"synthetic_emu","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/synthetic_emu","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"synthetic_emu","score":5,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Dashnote.app - 私のメモ書き/タスクトラッキングのサイドプロジェクト","the_new_excerpt":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Project Link:</strong> <a\nhref=\"http://dashnote.app/\"><strong>dashnote.app</strong></a><br/> Over the last\nこの半年間、私はあちこちの空き時間を使って、メモ書きやタスクの作成に費やしてきました。\n自分用のトラッキングアプリです。既存の製品をかなり使いました...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"Dashnote.app - 我的笔记/任务跟踪副业","the_new_excerpt":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Project Link:</strong> <a\nhref=\"http://dashnote.app/\"><strong>dashnote.app</strong></a><br/> Over the last\n6 months I&#39;ve spent my free time here and there building a note taking/task\ntracking app for myself.
