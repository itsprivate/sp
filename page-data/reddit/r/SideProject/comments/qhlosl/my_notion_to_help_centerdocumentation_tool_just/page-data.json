Excluding the two pre-order customers that paid $40 for a full year of HelpKit.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of marketing, I would say <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sobedominik/status/1451624399208005633\">building in public on Twitter</a> is helping me the most. Additionally, I also did two little growth hacks that have seemed to have helped. You can read about them here in <a href=\"https://www.indiehackers.com/post/first-customers-rolling-in-and-early-marketing-efforts-slowly-showing-results-655186902d\">this post</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Since everything is super early, unfortunately I don&#39;t have too much advice for you at this stage. That said, here are the <strong>three things I learned</strong> so far:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1)</strong> 👋Show up up every day and engage with your potential customers as best as you can. Yesterday someone wrote me: &quot;Thanks and really appreciate the personalised support!&quot; That&#39;s what you want to receive. If possible try to answer in a matter of hours and not the next day.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2)</strong> 🙅🏽‍♂️Don&#39;t bend your product or price too much in the beginning unless 99% of your requests are to do so. I have received a couple of emails telling me they would signup if the product would do X or decrease the price because of Y. If the requests are not part of your roadmap, it&#39;s better to just kindly tell them that. If they value what you do, they will sign up. If not, they won&#39;t. There are so many things to do and bending yourself just for this one potential customer is not worth it. A funny side note; One of these potential customers subscribed to the Premium plan and replied to my email with: &quot;Thanks - that&#39;s very helpful and appreciate the honesty!&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong>3)</strong> 🚀Build in public. BIP de-risks you on a personal level, people trust you and your product more and might also be more forgiving if you make some errors.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m excited for this journey and feel like this is just the start 🙂</p>\n\n<p>Let me know if you have any questions! Happy to answer.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/SideProject/comments/qhlosl/my_notion_to_help_centerdocumentation_tool_just/","title":"My Notion to Help Center/Documentation tool just reached $100 MRR.
