Previously, I shared on this sub about the growth of my newsletter <a href=\"https://indiegrow.substack.com/\">indiegrow,</a> and how it was nearing 100 subscribers. I got comments asking me to share strategies and learnings.</p>\n\n<p>This week I finally reached the milestone of 100 subscribers and thought I could share a couple of growth channels that work for me. If you are running a newsletter or creating content for your business, maybe these could help.</p>\n\n<p>For background, my newsletter is a free newsletter for entrepreneurs who want to grow their Twitter following. I send my subscribers three tweets daily to comment on (Engage through comments is the best way for small accounts to gain followers in the beginning). I mainly created this newsletter for myself and others: to make friends and have a community while working on our start-ups / growing on Twitter.</p>\n\n<p><strong>First 50 subscribers</strong></p>\n\n<p>My initial ~30 subscribers came mostly from Indiehackers and my Twitter account (a small account with less than 600 followers).</p>\n\n<p>I announced my newsletter on Twitter first and created a post on Indiehackers sharing announcing the launch. After seeing the interest, I felt more motivated and shared the newsletter around here, on startupschool forum and a few other slack groups. This gained ~10 additional subscribers.</p>\n\n<p>After these initial outreach, I have been marketing the newsletter on Twitter through daily shares of what I sent out -- this usually consists of a Twitter thread with three tweets I sent out and a little plug at the end. I also try to promote my newsletter in comments under threads by large accounts. These tactics eventually got me to 50 before my first post.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reaching 100 Subscribers</strong></p>\n\n<p>During the last couple of weeks, I prioritized consistency and not missing any day of the newsletter. I was also working on a launch with my co-founder, so I had less time to do marketing, but I try to promote whenever I can. I posted my newsletter on several newsletter directories and kept up with posting the threads on Twitter. I also posted my journey on indie hackers and a few other forums that I mentioned here. With time, it grew to 100.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summing up the growth channels</strong></p>\n\n<p>Channels I have tried so far:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Twitter</li>\n<li>Indiehackers</li>\n<li>startupschool forum</li>\n<li>Elpha</li>\n<li>Reddit</li>\n<li>my other newsletter</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Channels I have yet to try but curious about</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>fb groups</li>\n<li>product hunt discussion boards</li>\n<li>product hunt launch</li>\n<li>cross-promotions</li>\n<li>ads in other newsletters</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That&#39;s about it. In conclusion, what helps the most is sharing the journey and being consistent (Setting up a really good system for writing and sharing helps alot with that). The growth has slowed down a bit since the first two weeks, but I think there is a lot I can improve. For example, I feel there are better ways to do the daily twitter share, though I haven&#39;t figured out what or how. Setting up a referral system is another thing that&#39;s on the back of my mind. If you have any ideas, feel free to suggest them below. Also, if you are looking to grow on Twitter together, I hope you&#39;d consider <a href=\"https://indiegrow.substack.com/\">subscribing</a> indiegrow!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/SideProject/comments/qukdm7/growing_my_newsletter_to_100_subscribers_in_1/","title":"Growing my newsletter to 100 subscribers in 1 month, sharing my learnings and growth channels","tags":["SideProject","reddit"],"date":"November 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-15T23:59:02.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-15 23:59","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qukdm7","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/qukdm7/growing_my_newsletter_to_100_subscribers_in_1/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/qukdm7/growing_my_newsletter_to_100_subscribers_in_1/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/BWN1QxLvGR0LWqpw89doBGTojQTwacH-rdkdkZ0JO7o.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=81b9caf34ffb0a11a2b3c6791e5adfb4a48eb3c7","video":null,"channel":"SideProject","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject","author":"uhsauh","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/uhsauh","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"uhsauh","score":5,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"1ヶ月でニュースレターの購読者を100人に増やし、自分の学びと成長経路を共有する。","the_new_excerpt":"皆さん、こんにちは。以前、このサブで私のメルマガの成長についてご紹介しましたが\nindiegrow, [https://indiegrow.substack.com/]の登録者数が100人に近づいていることを紹介しました。\nの購読者がいることをお伝えしました。その際、戦略や学びを共有してほしいというコメントをいただきました。\n\n今週、ついに登録者数が100人という節目を迎えたので、私は...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"在1个月内将我的通讯发展到100个订阅者，分享我的学习和成长渠道","the_new_excerpt":"大家好! 之前，我在这个子上分享了关于我的通讯的增长情况\nindiegrow, [https://indiegrow.substack.com/] 以及它如何接近100个\n用户。我收到的评论要求我分享策略和经验。\n\n本周我终于达到了100个订阅者的里程碑，我想我...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在1個月內將我的通訊發展到100個訂閱者，分享我的學習和成長渠道","the_new_excerpt":"大家好! 之前，我在這個子上分享了關於我的通訊的增長情況\nindiegrow, [https://indiegrow.substack.com/] 以及它如何接近100個\n用戶。我收到的評論要求我分享策略和經驗。\n\n本週我終於達到了100個訂閱者的里程碑，我想我...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-quj94x","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/SideProject/comments/quj94x/ejectify_get_rid_of_disk_not_ejected_properly/","title":"Ejectify: Get rid of \"Disk not ejected properly\" notifications when your Mac wakes up.","date":"November 15, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"イジェクトする Macの起動時に表示される「ディスクが正しく取り出されませんでした」という通知をなくします。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"弹出。当你的Mac被唤醒时，摆脱 \"磁盘未正确弹出 \"的通知。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"彈出。當你的Mac被喚醒時，擺脫 \"磁盤未正確彈出 \"的通知。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-quvp2u","excerpt":"Notes App [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=notepad.quick.notes]","slug":"/reddit/r/SideProject/comments/quvp2u/i_made_an_app_android_that_combines_notes_and/","title":"I made an app [Android] that combines notes and reminders into one app with maximum privacy.
