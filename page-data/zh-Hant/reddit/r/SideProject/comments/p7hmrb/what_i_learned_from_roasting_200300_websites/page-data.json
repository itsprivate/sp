Think it&#39;s gonna be useful for a lot of the peeps here.</p>\n\n<p>Grab a tea/coffee/beer/tequila and let&#39;s get started!</p>\n\n<h1>#1. You&#39;re not getting SEO results unless you&#39;re actively doing SEO</h1>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve had a lot of people ask if their &quot;SEO was alright.&quot; The thing is, most of these people didn&#39;t have an SEO strategy in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, you can optimize your website based on SEO best practices (mention the keyword, include external/internal links, etc.), but that&#39;s nowhere near enough to get you to rank on Google.</p>\n\n<p>In order to drive SEO results for your website, you need to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Do keyword research and identify keywords you want to target (between 100-400 depending on the niche)</li>\n<li>Build your landing pages around these keywords as opposed to the other way around</li>\n<li>Write blog posts (if you&#39;re doing global SEO) targeting the keywords you found</li>\n<li>Optimize your site architecture by doing continuous internal linking</li>\n<li>Build backlinks to your website</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And a lot more.</p>\n\n<p>What I&#39;m getting at here is, SEO in 2021 is not something that &quot;just happens&quot; to your website. It&#39;s something you have to work for both actively and deliberately.</p>\n\n<p>Want to learn how to do SEO the right way? Check out my sub - <a href=\"/r/seogrowth\">/r/seogrowth</a>. Hope this doesn&#39;t come off as a self-insert, but I really think It&#39;s going to help a lot of people here. We&#39;re on a mission to make SEO accessible for everyone, and we&#39;d love to have you along for the trip :)</p>\n\n<p>That said, moving on to #2:</p>\n\n<h1>#2. Not all marketing channels are going to be relevant for your business</h1>\n\n<p>There are dozens of marketing channels you can use these days. Instagram ads, SEO, Google ads, and so many more.</p>\n\n<p>The thing is, though, that not all of these channels are going to be right for <strong>your business</strong> or your <strong>stage of growth.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For example, a lot of people with very fresh businesses (think, almost no customers) were asking how to do SEO.</p>\n\n<p>Well, the right answer here is that <strong>you shouldn&#39;t</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>For a new business, the most important thing you need to do is drive customers <strong>today</strong>, not next year.</p>\n\n<p>Unless you have a lot of VC capital, your business won&#39;t survive till your SEO kicks in.</p>\n\n<p>In such cases, you&#39;re better off using marketing channels with a more short-term impact. E.g. PPC ads, social media, direct outreach, and so on.</p>\n\n<h1>#3. Your website has to build trust</h1>\n\n<p>Waaaay too many websites I roasted looked extremely shady.</p>\n\n<p>Why? Because they had almost no information on who the person/team behind the website was.</p>\n\n<p>Say, I want to work with an accounting agency. The first thing I&#39;d do is check out their &quot;About Us&quot; page and see who&#39;s the team running the agency...</p>\n\n<p>And if their &quot;about us page&quot; is just generic copy-paste drivel with no team information, there&#39;s zero chance I&#39;m going to reach out to them.</p>\n\n<p>Want to add legitimacy to YOUR website? Here&#39;s what you can do:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Add client testimonials. Don&#39;t have any? Go offer your service for free to a business that you think you can help.</li>\n<li>Add an &quot;about us&quot; page with <strong>your team on it.</strong> Don&#39;t have a team/are a solo founder? That&#39;s totally OK - just frame your website copy around a solo founder.</li>\n<li>Add photos of yourself / your team. Your clients want to work with <strong>real people</strong> - not faceless, nameless websites.</li>\n<li>Be as specific as you can about your services. If you can make the client understand what&#39;s the <strong>exact</strong> work you&#39;re doing for them, they&#39;re almost as good as sold.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h1>#4. No one cares about your generic e-commerce website</h1>\n\n<p>If I want to order something online, 99% of the cases I&#39;ll just order from Amazon. I know, for a fact, that:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The delivery will be fast</li>\n<li>The price will be good</li>\n<li>I&#39;m going to get quality support if I need it</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now, if you want me to order from YOUR e-com store, you really have to work on your brand.</p>\n\n<p>Why should I order from YOUR website instead of Amazon?</p>\n\n<p>If your site is a list of random dropshipping products you scraped together, I ain&#39;t ordering.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re selling random household stuff (which I can get faster from Amazon), I ain&#39;t ordering.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if your store is built around a type of product line (e.g. you&#39;re selling Japanese streetwear clothing), then that&#39;s something a bit more unusual and interesting.</p>\n\n<h1>#5. If you&#39;re in a competitive niche, you have to differentiate your product/service</h1>\n\n<p>I NEVER tell people that they&#39;re in an oversaturated niche. I truly believe that if you&#39;re good at what you do and passionate about your business, you&#39;ll stand out even in a very overcrowded niche.</p>\n\n<p>That said, to make that happen, you need to differentiate your product/service.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s say, for example, you have a crypto/blockchain blog. You won&#39;t be able to compete with big media in terms of how fast/well you cover crypto news. Chances are, you also won&#39;t be able to outrank them on Google (unless you&#39;re going to spend a TON of money on link-building or PR).</p>\n\n<p>So, what can you do to stand out with YOUR blog?</p>\n\n<p>Here are some examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Cover crypto topics in simple English. Most blockchain content is very hard to understand for an outsider. Help solve that problem.</li>\n<li>Cover crypto topics in your native language. Most crypto content on the web is in English, so this could be a good way to niche down.</li>\n<li>Cover niche crypto projects big websites don&#39;t talk about as much.</li>\n<li>Do breakdowns of white papers of big projects. Most people don&#39;t want to spend 3 hours reading a white paper, so you could do videos that summarize them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>#6. It&#39;s 2021 - there&#39;s no excuse NOT to write good content</h1>\n\n<p>Around 10 years back, you could maintain a blog audience with subpar content.</p>\n\n<p>Today, literally everyone and their grandma writes blog content. Businesses, freelancers, bloggers, e-com stores, agencies, they all have a blog, and they&#39;re all publishing content.</p>\n\n<p>With so much content out there, you really need to create exceptional content in order to stand out.</p>\n\n<p>What&#39;s good content, you might ask?</p>\n\n<p>Well, good content is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Well-written and easy to read</li>\n<li>Jam-packed with graphics and images</li>\n<li>Includes examples and case studies</li>\n<li>Well-formatted. 2-4 sentences per paragraph, no blocks of text</li>\n<li>Written with an audience in mind</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h1>And that&#39;s about it!</h1>\n\n<p>I&#39;m planning on doing another roast thread soon, so if you missed the last one, stay tuned ;)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/SideProject/comments/p7hmrb/what_i_learned_from_roasting_200300_websites/","title":"What I Learned from Roasting 200-300 Websites' SEO/marketing/landing copy/etc.","tags":["SideProject","reddit"],"date":"August 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-08-19T17:05:55.000Z","datetime":"2021-08-19 17:05","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"p7hmrb","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/p7hmrb/what_i_learned_from_roasting_200300_websites/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/p7hmrb/what_i_learned_from_roasting_200300_websites/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"SideProject","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject","author":"malchik23","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/malchik23","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"malchik23","score":5,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"200～300サイトのSEO/マーケティング/ランディングコピーなどを焙煎してわかったこと。","the_new_excerpt":"少し前にこんなスレッドを立てました。\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/otew4k/im_going_to_roast_your_website_seo_copy_marketing/]\nマーケティング、SEO、ランディング・ページ・コピーなどの観点から、たくさんのウェブサイトを煎じて飲むという内容でした。\nページのコピーなどについて、たくさんのウェブサイトを批判しました。\n\nそして、面白いことに、私はほとんどのウェブサイトが...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我从200-300个网站的SEO/营销/登陆文案等方面学到的东西。","the_new_excerpt":"前一段时间，我做了这个主题\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/otew4k/im_going_to_roast_your_website_seo_copy_marketing/]\n在那里我对一大堆网站的营销、搜索引擎优化、登陆页面的文案等方面进行了评估。\n页副本，以及更多。\n\n有趣的是，我注意到大多数的网站我...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我從200-300個網站的SEO/營銷/登陸文案等方面學到的東西。","the_new_excerpt":"前一段時間，我做了這個主題\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/otew4k/im_going_to_roast_your_website_seo_copy_marketing/]\n在那裏我對一大堆網站的營銷、搜索引擎優化、登陸頁面的文案等方面進行了評估。\n頁副本，以及更多。\n\n有趣的是，我注意到大多數的網站我...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-p78twr","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/SideProject/comments/p78twr/i_made_an_app_to_read_text_in_images_aloud/","title":"I made an app to read text in images aloud","date":"August 19, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"画像内の文字を読み上げるアプリを作ってみた","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我做了一个应用程序，可以大声读出图片中的文字","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我做了一個應用程序，可以大聲讀出圖片中的文字","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-p7khiq","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/SideProject/comments/p7khiq/i_made_a_browser_extension_that_lets_you_bypass/","title":"I made a browser extension that lets you bypass Netflix geo-restrictions content.","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"August 19, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Netflixの地域制限コンテンツを回避できるブラウザ拡張機能を作りました。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我做了一个浏览器扩展，让你绕过Netflix的地理限制内容。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我做了一個瀏覽器擴展，讓你繞過Netflix的地理限制內容。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-p7hmrb","previousId":"RedditPost-p78twr","nextId":"RedditPost-p7khiq","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":null,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/SideProject/comments/p7hmrb/what_i_learned_from_roasting_200300_websites/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2744905544","3280999885"]}
