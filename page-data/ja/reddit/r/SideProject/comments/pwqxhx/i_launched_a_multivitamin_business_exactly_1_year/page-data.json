In a global pandemic, starting a multivitamin company was the obvious natural move for me...</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve learnt a heck of a lot over the past 12 months, so I thought I&#39;d share some of my learnings, and hopefully it can help someone on their journey.</p>\n\n<p>Here goes...</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Word of Mouth is the goal</strong></p>\n\n<p>When people receive your product, they need to be &#39;wowed&#39;. This could be due to the packaging, speed of delivery, the product itself. But it needs to make an impact.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re successful at this, then these people will tell their friends - this is easily the best marketing you can get. Wow your customer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Shipping</strong></p>\n\n<p>I spent the first 3 months packaging all of the orders myself, whilst working fulltime for a bank. It was exhausting, and more importantly, ate up all my free time in the evenings.</p>\n\n<p>I was spending hours packaging orders when I could have been doing more valuable things like marketing. </p>\n\n<p>Outsource your shipping as soon as it becomes viable, you won&#39;t regret it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Don&#39;t Be Afraid To Ask For Help</strong></p>\n\n<p>When I launched, I messaged 500 of my Facebook friends letting them know. About 10 bought! Not amazing returns, but not awful!</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;ll be shocked how willing your friends are to help you, but don&#39;t be afraid to ask!</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Brand Partnerships</strong></p>\n\n<p>Growing can be really difficult as a start up, especially if you&#39;re budget is tight. </p>\n\n<p>We found partnering up with 1 or 2 brands who could stock our product on their website to be super effective. It gave us 2 new audiences with customers willing to buy. On those days where your Shopify store does 10 views, it feels great to have some sales come in from your partnerships.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Pay The Money</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re a new founder, chances are you&#39;ve been scouring Fiverr trying to find someone to create your logo. Heck, I did. £10 for someone to make it, awesome.</p>\n\n<p>However, a few months later, after building some knowledge in the industry, I realised our logo sucked.</p>\n\n<p>It really made that saying hit home, &quot;buy cheap by twice&quot;. Luckily, we didn&#39;t make that mistake with our website hosting platform. Shopify is worth every bit of the monthly fee, highly recommend to those considering!</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Repeat Purchases</strong></p>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t know how important these were until about month 6. Turns out, it&#39;s a lot cheaper to retain existing customers than it is finding new ones.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if customers are repeatedly buying your product, it shows good product market fit. The holy grail - a space in the industry where your product meets the needs of your user. </p>\n\n<p>Find ways to incentivise repeat purchases, whether that&#39;s a slick email campaign, or a valuable subscription offer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>And that&#39;s it, 6 things I&#39;ve learnt on this founder journey of mine. Hopefully it was able to help someone out their take the next step in their own journey.</p>\n\n<p>Peace,</p>\n\n<p>Josh</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/SideProject/comments/pwqxhx/i_launched_a_multivitamin_business_exactly_1_year/","title":"I launched a multivitamin business exactly 1 year ago, here's what I have learnt","tags":["SideProject","reddit"],"date":"September 28, 2021","dateISO":"2021-09-28T06:36:49.000Z","datetime":"2021-09-28 06:36","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"pwqxhx","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/pwqxhx/i_launched_a_multivitamin_business_exactly_1_year/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/pwqxhx/i_launched_a_multivitamin_business_exactly_1_year/","imageRemote":"https://external-preview.redd.it/JsFuZw9MyHt8OfXjNmK1HYkEUM0A2dp5tEj2apcLjLg.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=126e6e7dcc7cb80520e5400efb2592e5c8fe7349","video":null,"channel":"SideProject","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject","author":"Josh_Jackson10","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Josh_Jackson10","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Josh_Jackson10","score":5,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ちょうど1年前にマルチビタミンのビジネスを立ち上げましたが、その時に学んだことは以下の通りです。","the_new_excerpt":"皆さん、こんにちは。\n\n私は去年の今頃、Hakamount [https://hakamount.co.uk/] を設立しました。\nロンドンの銀行でフルタイムで働く傍ら、昨年末にhakamountを設立しました。世界的なパンデミックの中、マルチビタミンの会社を立ち上げることは、私にとって当然の行動でした。\n世界的な大流行の中、マルチビタミンの会社を始めることは、私にとって明らかに自然な動きでした。\n\nこの12ヶ月間で非常に多くのことを学んだので、私は...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"我在一年前启动了多种维生素业务，以下是我学到的东西","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，伙计们。\n\n我是乔希--去年这个时候我创立了哈卡蒙[https://hakamount.co.uk/]\n同时在伦敦的一家银行全职工作。在全球大流行的情况下，创办一家\n对我来说，创办一家综合维生素公司是显而易见的自然之举......\n\n在过去的12个月里，我学到了很多东西，所以我想我要...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我在一年前啓動了多種維生素業務，以下是我學到的東西","the_new_excerpt":"嘿，夥計們。\n\n我是喬希--去年這個時候我創立了哈卡蒙[https://hakamount.co.uk/]\n同時在倫敦的一家銀行全職工作。在全球大流行的情況下，創辦一家\n對我來說，創辦一家綜合維生素公司是顯而易見的自然之舉......\n\n在過去的12個月裏，我學到了很多東西，所以我想我要...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-pw3nh0","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/SideProject/comments/pw3nh0/website_builder_using_react_redux/","title":"Website Builder using React & Redux","date":"September 27, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"ReactとReduxを使ったウェブサイトビルダー","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"使用React和Redux的网站建设者","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"使用React和Redux的網站建設者","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-px7w98","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/SideProject/comments/px7w98/selfparking_car_evolution_simulator/","title":"Self-Parking Car Evolution Simulator","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"September 28, 2021","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Self-Parking Car Evolution Simulator","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"自动泊车器的演变模拟器","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"自動泊車器的演變模擬器","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-pwqxhx","previousId":"RedditPost-pw3nh0","nextId":"RedditPost-px7w98","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://sideproject.buzzing.cc","author":"Buzzing.cc","locale":"zh","title":"业余项目分享交流","shortTitle":"业余项目","description":"用中文浏览reddit业余项目讨论","keywords":["buzzing","业余项目","程序员"],"telegram":"@buzzingcc","telegram_chat_id":"-1001406368978","iconUrl":"https://sideproject.buzzing.cc/avatar.png","menuLinks":[],"subscriptions":[{"name":"Twitter @buzzingcc","url":"https://twitter.com/buzzingcc","external":true},{"name":"Telegram @buzzingcc","url":"https://t.me/buzzingcc","external":true},{"name":"RSS","url":"/rss.xml","prefetch":false}],"social":[{"name":"SideProject","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/","external":true},{"name":"Buzzing","url":"https://www.buzzing.cc/","external":true}],"localize":[{"locale":"en","title":"Buzzing on Side Project","shortTitle":"BuzzNews","description":"See what's buzzing on Side Project in your native language","keywords":["buzzing","Side Project"],"menuLinks":[]},{"locale":"zh-Hant","title":"業餘項目分享交流","shortTitle":"業餘項目","description":"用中文瀏覽reddit業餘項目討論","keywords":["buzzing","業餘項目","程序員"],"menuLinks":[]},{"locale":"ja","title":"サイドプロジェクト","shortTitle":"サイドプロジェクト","description":"人気のサイドプロジェクトを日本語で閲覧","keywords":["buzzing","サイドプロジェクト"],"menuLinks":[]}],"defaultSocialImageUrl":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1624129591276-5b11185e7b42?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2739&q=80"},"locale":"ja","hrefLang":"ja-JA","originalPath":"/reddit/r/SideProject/comments/pwqxhx/i_launched_a_multivitamin_business_exactly_1_year/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},
